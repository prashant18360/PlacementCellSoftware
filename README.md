# PlacementCellSoftware
Placements are about to start at IIITD and you have been approached by the placement office for designing a software application for simplifying the application procedure. The purpose of this software is to allow the students to register themselves for applying to different companies visiting for campus placements. These companies would use this information to shortlist potential candidates.
